This contains the data set of birth/death records taken from https://drc.libraries.uc.edu/handle/2374.UC/2032
The dataset has been cleaned somewhat to address the 2200 records that had a missing field and so data was shifted. 
The files in this collection include the OpenRefine archive file of the dataset with the JSON file of what was done to clean the data from the original CSV
